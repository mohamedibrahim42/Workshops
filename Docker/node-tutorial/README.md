# Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Up and Running with Node.JS, Express, Jade, and MongoDB

A tutorial and complete sample project for Front-End developers showing how to get Node, Express and Jade up and running, connected to MongoDB, and reading from / writing to the database.

## Quickstart

If you want to run this example code, you will need to do an NPM Install, as the node_modules directory has been removed from this repository. You'll also need to set up a MongoDB database. I highly recommend just going through the tutorial!

1. npm install
2. npm start
3. http://localhost:3009/newuser
